breaths: basically used data from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_rate .  got a rough guide of 87850800
 breaths in first ten years (during which an adult could expect 57294000), so calculate as if an adult and then add the difference (30556800).  as such this wont work for those younger than ten



poo: just took the daily average.  it'll be much higher for asian countries.  probably babies poo more, but children less, so that'll even out maybe.  weight is also a huge factor

wee: took the average of 1.4 liters, and took away 7 years (assuming that the first 14 years might average half?)



sleep: assumed 8 hours a day, plus an extra 14965 based on extra during early years:
5 years + 4
8 years + 2
5 years + 1
14965



pollutin data comes from https://www.theguardian.com/environment/datablog/2009/sep/02/carbon-emissions-per-person-capita
ame can aus is 20ish, europe 10ish.  i'll go with 20.
### http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC?name_desc=true
actually, let's stick with 365.2*17 = 0.046549836
